Lineups
Get the lineups for a fixture.

Lineups are available between 20 and 40 minutes before the fixture when the competition covers this feature. You can check this with the endpoint leagues and the coverage field.

It's possible that for some competitions the lineups are not available before the fixture, in this case, they are updated and available after the match with a variable delay depending on the competition.
