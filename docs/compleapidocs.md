Introduction
Welcome to Api-Football! You can use our API to access all API endpoints, which can get information about Football Leagues & Cups.

We have language bindings in C, C#, cURL, Dart, Go, Java, Javascript, NodeJs, Objective-c, OCaml, Php, PowerShell, Python, Ruby, Shell and Swift! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The update frequency indicated in the documentation is given as an indication and may vary for certain competitions.

Authentication
We uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key in our dashboard.

API-SPORTS : https://v3.football.api-sports.io/

Our API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

Make sure to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx with your API key.

REQUESTS HEADERS & CORS

The API is configured to work only with GET requests and allows only the headers listed below:

x-apisports-key
If you make non-GET requests or add headers that are not in the list, you will receive an error from the API.

Some frameworks (especially in JS, nodeJS..) automatically add extra headers, you have to make sure to remove them in order to get a response from the API.

API-SPORTS Account
If you decided to subscribe directly on our site, you have a dashboard at your disposal at the following url: dashboard

It allows you to:

To follow your consumption in real time
Manage your subscription and change it if necessary
Check the status of our servers
Test all endpoints without writing a line of code.
You can also consult all this information directly through the API by calling the endpoint status.

This call does not count against the daily quota.

get("https://v3.football.api-sports.io/status");

// response
{
"get": "status",
"parameters": [],
"errors": [],
"results": 1,
"response": {
"account": {
"firstname": "xxxx",
"lastname": "XXXXXX",
"email": "xxx@xxx.com"
},
"subscription": {
"plan": "Free",
"end": "2020-04-10T23:24:27+00:00",
"active": true
},
"requests": {
"current": 12,
"limit_day": 100
}
}
}
Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:

x-ratelimit-requests-limit: The number of requests allocated per day according to your subscription.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: The number of remaining requests per day according to your subscription.
X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum number of API calls per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining: Number of API calls remaining before reaching the limit per minute.
Rate Limiting Policy
If you exceed your allowed request rate per minute, either through continuous excessive usage or by generating abnormal traffic spikes, your access may be temporarily or permanently blocked by our firewall without prior notice. This ensures service stability and fair usage for all customers.

Logos / Images
Calls to logos/images do not count towards your daily quota and are provided for free. However these calls are subject to a rate per second & minute, it is recommended to save this data on your side in order not to slow down or impact the user experience of your application or website. For this you can use CDNs such as bunny.net.

We have a tutorial available here, which explains how to set up your own media system with BunnyCDN.

Logos, images and trademarks delivered through the API are provided solely for identification and descriptive purposes (e.g., identifying leagues, teams, players or venues). We does not own any of these visual assets, and no intellectual property rights are claimed over them. Some images or data may be subject to intellectual property or trademark rights held by third parties (including but not limited to leagues, federations, or clubs). The use of such content in your applications, websites, or products may require additional authorization or licensing from the respective rights holders. You are fully responsible for ensuring that your usage of any logos, images, or branded content complies with applicable laws in your country or the countries where your services are made available. We are not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any sports league, federation, or brand featured in the data provided.

Sample Scripts
Here are some examples of how the API is used in the main development languages.

You have to replace {endpoint} by the real name of the endpoint you want to call, like leagues or fixtures for example. In all the sample scripts we will use the leagues endpoint as example.

Also you will have to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx with your API-KEY provided in the dashboard.

Widgets
API-SPORTS widgets allow you to easily display dynamic sports data on your website.

They are designed to be:

Ultra-modular: each component is autonomous
Customisable: language, theme, content, behaviour
Easy to integrate: no framework required, a simple HTML tag is all you need
They use request from your API-SPORTS account and work with all plans, including the free plan.

Find all the documentation on widgets here


Security
Our widgets use your account's API-KEY, which must be specified in the data-key attribute of your widget configuration.

When using these widgets it is important to be aware that your API-KEY will be visible to the users of your site, it is possible to protect yourself from this by allowing only the desired domains or IP in our dashboard. This way no one else can use your API-KEY for you. If you have already set up your widget and have not activated this option, you can reset your API-KEY and activate this option after.

You can further enhance security by completely hiding your API-KEY from the source code by following this tutorial.

Caching Data
By using Widgets, each visit to a page on your website triggers one or more API requests to retrieve data. Without a caching system, your daily quota can be reached very quickly.

Example: If a page triggers a single API request per visitor and you receive 80 visits to that page in one minute, this results in 80 API requests. Over a full day, that can add up to 115 200 requests.

By implementing a caching system, even with a very short duration, such as 60 seconds, you can drastically reduce the number of requests. The first visit will trigger an API request, but the response will then be cached for the next 60 seconds. This means that if 80 visitors access the same page within that time frame, only the first request will reach the API, while the next 79 will be served directly from the cache.

With this system in place, you reduce usage from 115 200 requests per day to just 1 440.

A full tutorial is available here, explaining step by step how to set up an effective caching system.

Debugging
If the widget does not display the requested information, it is possible to set the data-show-errors tag to true to display error messages directly in the widget and in the console. This can be due to several things like : (Non-exhaustive list)

You have reached your daily number of requests
Tags are incorrectly filled in
Your API-KEY is incorrect
All available widgets
Below is a list of all available widgets:

games → list of matches
game → details of a match
team → team profile
player → player profile
standings → league table
league → schedule
leagues → list of all leagues
h2h → historical head-to-head
races, race, driver → Formula 1
fights, fight, fighter → MMA
Each widget adapts automatically based on the selected sport.

Before You Begin
Dynamic targeting
Some widgets, such as games, can dynamically open other widgets like game, standings, player, and more.
This interaction is enabled using the data-target-* attributes.

These attributes allow you to define where the opened widget should be rendered:

modal → renders the widget inside a modal.
CSS selector (#id or .class) → injects the widget into a specific HTML element on the page.
These targeting options are available for:

General sports widgets (Football, Basketball, etc.):

data-target-game
data-target-standings
data-target-team
data-target-player
data-target-league
Formula 1 specific:

data-target-race
data-target-ranking
data-target-driver
MMA specific:

data-target-fight
data-target-fighter
Target a container by ID

  <api-sports-widget data-type="games"></api-sports-widget>
  
  <div id="details"></div>

  <api-sports-widget
    data-type="config"
    data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
    data-sport="football"
    data-target-game="#details"
  ></api-sports-widget>
Target using modal

  <api-sports-widget data-type="games"></api-sports-widget>

  <api-sports-widget
    data-type="config"
    data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
    data-sport="football"
    data-target-game="modal"
  ></api-sports-widget>
Language
The data-lang attribute allows you to easily switch the interface language of all widgets.

Available languages:
en (English)
fr (French)
es (Spanish)
it (Italian)
Example usage

<api-sports-widget
  data-type="config"
  data-key="Your-Api-Key"
  data-sport="football"
  data-lang="en"
  data-custom-lang="https://yourdomain.com/lang/en.json"
></api-sports-widget>
Example


Custom translations:
For complete control over wording, you can load your own translation file using data-custom-lang.
This file must be a valid JSON object following the internal key structure.

You can download the translation file here.

It allows you to:

Override specific labels
Translate missing terms
Adapt terminology to your audience
Example JSON format:

{
  "all": "All",
  "live": "Now Live",
  "finished": "Completed",
  "scheduled": "Coming Up",
  "favorites": "Favorites",
}
You can use data-lang and data-custom-lang together.
If a key is defined in both, the custom file will take priority.

Exemple for custom translation

  <api-sports-widget data-type="games" data-target-game="modal"></api-sports-widget>

  <api-sports-widget
    data-type="config"
    data-key="Your-Api-Key-Here"
    data-sport="football"
    data-lang="custom"
    data-custom-lang="https://yourdomain.com/lang/custom.json"
  ></api-sports-widget>
You have a tutorial available here

Predefined themes
Four built-in themes are available by default. You can set them using the data-theme attribute on any widget.

white (default)
grey
dark
blue
Each theme adjusts background colors, text colors, button styles, borders, and more.

White
 Grey


Dark
 Blue


Custom theme
You can override the default styles by creating your own CSS theme using the data-theme attribute and custom variable declarations.

Example:

api-sports-widget[data-theme="MyTheme"] {
  --primary-color: #18cfc0;
  --success-color: #2ecc58;
  --warning-color: #f39c12;
  --danger-color: #e74c3c;
  --light-color: #898989;

  --home-color: var(--primary-color);
  --away-color: #ffc107;

  --text-color: #333;
  --text-color-info: #333;

  --background-color: #fff;

  --primary-font-size: 0.72rem;
  --secondary-font-size: 0.75rem;
  --button-font-size: 0.8rem;

Leagues
Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.

The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons

To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url: https://media.api-sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.png

This endpoint also returns the coverage of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is available for that league or cup.

The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be updated once the competition has started.

You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.

Example :

"coverage": {
  "fixtures": {
      "events": true,
      "lineups": true,
      "statistics_fixtures": false,
      "statistics_players": false
  },
  "standings": true,
  "players": true,
  "top_scorers": true,
  "top_assists": true,
  "top_cards": true,
  "injuries": true,
  "predictions": true,
  "odds": false
}
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: statistics_fixtures, statistics_players, odds because it is set to False.

The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee 100% data availability.

Some competitions, such as the friendlies, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.

Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

For Cup competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated several times a day.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per hour.

Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to fixtures with the status PST, CANC.

The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.

Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result. In this case, the status remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the competition).

Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay between reality and the availability of data in the API.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in progress otherwise 1 call per day.

This endpoint returns the players for whom the profile and statistics data are available. Note that it is possible that a player has statistics for 2 teams in the same season in case of transfers.

The statistics are calculated according to the team id, league id and season.

You can find the available seasons by using the endpoint players/seasons.

To get the squads of the teams it is better to use the endpoint players/squads.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 5 seconds.*

* This value can change in the range of 5 to 60 seconds

INFORMATIONS ABOUT STATUS

    "blocked": false, // True if bets on this fixture are temporarily blocked
    "finished": false // True if the fixture has not started or if it is finished
},
INFORMATIONS ABOUT VALUES
